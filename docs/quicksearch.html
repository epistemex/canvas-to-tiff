The TIFF file is standard baseline compliant and supports RGB + alpha channel as well as compression at various compression levels, and with option for byte-order (big-endian or little-endian) as well as DPI settings. Features Fast Asynchronous and non-blocking Supports alpha channel Supports optional ZIP compression (async) Convert directly to ArrayBuffer Convert directly to Blob Convert directly to Data-URI Support both big-endian (default) and little-endian byte order Can set arbitrary DPI for X and Y directions Can obtain a web-gl based canvas as well. Documented source incl. HTML version (see docs/ folder) Works with all major browsers incl. IE No dependencies (ezlib deflate if compression is wanted. Included). Install Bower: bower install canvas-to-tiff Git using HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/epistemex/canvas-to-tiff.git Git using SSH: git clone git@github.com:epistemex/canvas-to-tiff.git Download zip archive and extract. canvastotiff.min.js UsageInclude the script in header or before the script section in your HTML file. To convert the canvas to a TIFF file: CanvasToTIFF.toDataURL(canvas, function(uri) { // uri is a Data-URI that can be used as source for images etc. // uri = &quot;data:image/tiff;base64, ...etc...&quot;; });A faster option to Data-URIs is using Blobs: CanvasToTIFF.toBlob(canvas, function(blob) { // blob object can be converted to an objectURL and then // set as source for images, or as download target: var url = URL.createObjectURL(blob); });For convenience, a direct Canvas to ObjectURL method is included: CanvasToTIFF.toObjectURL(canvas, function(url) { // can be used as source for image or download target });To convert it to an ArrayBuffer that can be sent over the net: CanvasToTIFF.toArrayBuffer(canvas, function(buffer) { // buffer is ArrayBuffer with the TIFF file });Also see www/test.html for sample use of compression and byte-order options. NOTE: As with ordinary canvas Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements must be fulfilled. TIP: The ezlib library is included to support ZIP compression. It can be left out to reduce code size (see canvastotiff_no_deflate.min.js [2.7 kb]). CanvasToTIFF will adopt automatically and accordingly if not found, and produce a uncompressed TIFF file instead.

The TIFF is by default saved in big-endian format as interleaved RGBA and ZIP compressed data. Methods &lt;static&gt; toArrayBuffer(canvas, callback [, options]) Convert a 2D canvas context to a ArrayBuffer containing a TIFF file. Includes the alpha channel. The call is asynchronous so a callback must be provided. The image data is ZIP compressed by default. Note that CORS requirements must be fulfilled. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description canvas HTMLCanvasElement the canvas element to export callback function called when conversion is done. Argument is ArrayBuffer options object &lt;optional&gt; an option object Properties Name Type Argument Default Description compress boolean &lt;optional&gt; true enable ZIP compression (requires ezlib deflate - if not available it will revert gracefully to uncompressed) compressionLevel number &lt;optional&gt; 6 if compression is enabled, defined compression level [0, 9] where 9 is best/slowest. littleEndian boolean &lt;optional&gt; false set to true to produce a little-endian based TIFF dpi number &lt;optional&gt; 96 DPI for both X and Y directions. Default 96 DPI (PPI). dpiX number &lt;optional&gt; 96 DPI for X directions (overrides options.dpi). dpiY number &lt;optional&gt; 96 DPI for Y directions (overrides options.dpi). onError function &lt;optional&gt; Set error handler &lt;static&gt; toBlob(canvas, callback [, options]) Converts a canvas to TIFF file, returns a Blob representing the file. This can be used with URL.createObjectURL(). The call is asynchronous so a callback must be provided. Note that CORS requirement must be fulfilled. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description canvas HTMLCanvasElement the canvas element to convert callback function called when conversion is done. Argument is a Blob options object &lt;optional&gt; an option object - see toArrayBuffer for details &lt;static&gt; toDataURL(canvas, callback [, options]) Converts the canvas to an data-URI representing a TIFF file. The call is asynchronous so a callback must be provided. Note that CORS requirement must be fulfilled. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description canvas HTMLCanvasElement the canvas element to convert callback function called when conversion is done. Argument is an data-URI (string) options object &lt;optional&gt; an option object - see toArrayBuffer for details &lt;static&gt; toObjectURL(canvas, callback [, options]) Converts a canvas to TIFF file, returns an ObjectURL (for Blob) representing the file. The call is asynchronous so a callback must be provided. When no longer needed the Object-URL should be revoked to release memory: (window.URL || window.webkitURL).revokeObjectURL(url);Note that CORS requirement must be fulfilled. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description canvas HTMLCanvasElement the canvas element to convert callback function called when conversion is done. Argument is a Blob options object &lt;optional&gt; an option object - see toArrayBuffer for details × Search results Close Epistemex at GitHub "}}
